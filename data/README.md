## cache-cloud-disk-oct9-oct13

Source data and results from the `Hadoop` dataset used in Fig. 1 of the RainMon paper. Plot with `python plotjson.py fig1`

## cache-cloud-disk-oct12-oct16

Source data and results from the `Hadoop` dataset used in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 of the RainMon paper. Plot with `python plotjson.py fig8` and `python plotjson.py fig9`

## cache-machine-groups

Source data and results from the `Hadoop` dataset used in Fig. 11 of the RainMon paper. First unpack this to a directory `cache` and run `python plotjson.py fig11`
